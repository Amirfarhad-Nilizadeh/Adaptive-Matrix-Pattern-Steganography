# Adaptive Matrix Pattern Steganography on RGB

Adaptive Matrix Pattern (AMP) is an adaptive spatial domain image steganography algorithm for hiding digital media based on matrix pattern. 
The AMP method increases the security of the steganography scheme of largely hidden messages since it adaptively generates a unique codebook matrix pattern for each ASCII character in each image block. Therefore, each ASCII character gets a different codebook matrix pattern even in different regions of the same image. 
Moreover, it uses a preprocessing algorithm to identify the most suitable image blocks for hiding purposes. The resulting stego-images are robust against LSB blind attacks since the middle bits of green and blue channels generate matrix patterns and hiding secrets, respectively. Also, obtained experimental results prove that AMP is robust against quantitative steganalyses. Additionally, the quality of stego-images, based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio metric, remains high in both stego-RGB-image and stego-blue-channel. Finally, the AMP method provides a high hiding capacity, up to 1.33 bits per pixel.
