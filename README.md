# Adaptive-Multimedia-Steganography-based-on-Matrix-Pattern
 We present an adaptive multimedia steganography algorithm based on a ``Matrix Pattern'' method. This method first divides a selected RGB image into non-overlapping square-sized blocks. Then, a pre-analysis based on ``block texture pattern detection'' is used, to sort blocks in a queue, from the most to the least suitable. Then, 257 unique dynamically-sized matrix patterns are generated automatically. The $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ bit of the green channel of each block are used for generating matrix patterns (which makes the method resistant against some blind attacks). Next, each of these unique matrix patterns are assigned to 256 standard ASCII characters and an ``end of message'' character. Then, the $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ bit of the blue channel of each block is used for hiding a secret message. Matrix patterns that are assigned to the characters of the secret message are added to that channel. RGB images of BOSSBase dataset is used in our experimental results. We present results of evaluating this method against statistical and machine learning steganalysis.
